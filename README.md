# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I had to create a deep Q-learning alogorithm for an intelligent agent to play a treasure hunt game in which it finds a treasure before pirates do. All of the code for this treasure hunt game was supplied aside from the deep Q-learning algorithm, which I had to implement myself. The given code included a file that represents the game environment and a file that stores the game episodes. The deep Q-learning algorithm I implemented allowed the agent to find the best possible navigation to the treasure while maximizing rewards. 
    
# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists study computers and their systems, as well as find ways to innovate using computer technology. This is important because computers have become such a huge part of society, so we need people who understand them, can maintain them, and can create further innovation with them. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems with a mix of creativity and methodical and logical processes. It is important to understand the problem, and map out a logical solution to solve it. It is also important to be creative in the computer science field, as this is what leads to new ideas and innovation. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist to the end user and organization are to be aware of how my technology and contributions will impact society. It's important to ensure technology, especially artificial intelligence, avoids bias and conforms to privacy practices. Technology influences society in so many different ways, so computer scientists have a huge responsibility in ensuring its safety for everyone.
